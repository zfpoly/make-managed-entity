The <info>%command.name%</info> creates or updates a Doctrine entity class with a Manager to handle its crud operations,
and optionally an API Platform resource.

<info>php %command.full_name% BlogPost</info>

If the argument is missing, the command will ask for the entity class name interactively.

You can also mark this class as an API Platform resource. A hypermedia CRUD API will
automatically be available for this entity class:

<info>php %command.full_name% --api-resource</info>

You can also generate all the getter/setter/adder/remover methods
for the properties of existing entities:

<info>php %command.full_name% --regenerate</info>

You can also *overwrite* any existing methods:

<info>php %command.full_name% --regenerate --overwrite</info>
